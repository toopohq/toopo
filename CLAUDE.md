# Toopo

A registry of utility functions verified against public, executable contracts, distributed as
source code copied into the user's codebase.

A **contract** is the complete, executable behavioural specification of one function: identity,
TypeScript signature, property-based invariants, named and settled edge cases, and benchmark
profiles. The contract is owned by the registry; implementations compete underneath it and are
interchangeable.

The product of this project is the contract, not the utility code. **If the verification is
decorative, the project has no reason to exist.** That sentence is the acceptance criterion for
every change made here.

## Current stage

Five contracts are being written **by hand**, with no shared abstraction, so that the definitive
contract format emerges from repetition rather than being designed up front. The uncertainty of
this project lies in the contract format, not in the API or the CLI — which is why neither exists
yet.

- Contracts written so far: `number/parse@1`, `date/add@1`.
- Project name: Toopo. CLI command `toopo`, lockfile `toopo.lock`.

## Error convention — settled, catalogue-wide

A fallible function returns `T | null` and publishes a diagnostic export **beside** it:
`describe<X>Failure(...)`, returning a reason literal owned by that contract, or `null`. No type is
shared between features — each contract declares its own literals.

Every contract that publishes a diagnostic carries a **coupling property**: a call fails exactly
when it has a description. Without it the two exports can drift, and an implementation that
optimises the answering path while leaving the diagnostic one alone will diverge on any input the
named cases do not cover.

Three forms were built and measured across both prototype contracts. The union
`{ ok, value } | { ok, reason }` ties this one on detection, so the error convention is not a
verification question. Read that tie at the strength it was actually measured: on `date/add@1` it is
a full-battery tie, every mutant under both lenses; on `number/parse@1` it rests on four mutants
under one lens. What decided it is that this form is **additive**: a contract can ship
`name@1` with no diagnostic and gain one later without breaking anyone, whereas putting the reason
in the return type freezes it into the major version on day one. Known costs are recorded in the
project specification, together with what would invalidate the decision.

Those measurements are replayable, at three annotated tags whose messages say what each one proves:
`evidence/error-convention-round-1` (two forms, six call sites), `evidence/error-convention-round-2`
(three forms on both contracts, and the batteries the detection tie comes from) and
`evidence/error-convention-round-3` (the callers that need the value and the reason at once). They
are tags rather than branches because the conclusion is on `main` and nobody should be reading three
dead working states — but a published sentence with no replayable measurement behind it is an
opinion, which is the one thing this repository sells against.

**The reason set of a contract is frozen with its major version.** Adding a literal, removing one,
or splitting one all break a caller that switches exhaustively — so the partition is chosen once,
deliberately, and a later change costs `name@2`. The additivity that decided this convention covers
gaining a diagnostic, not reshaping one.

## Rules for this stage

1. Contracts and their reference implementations only. No backend, no API, no CLI, no website, no
   CI configuration, no publishing tooling. Those come after the five prototypes, deliberately.
2. **No abstraction across contracts until at least three exist.** Duplication between contract
   folders is expected and correct here — factoring early would fabricate the format instead of
   discovering it. This suspension of the no-duplication rule applies nowhere else.
3. Dev dependencies are limited to `typescript`, `vitest`, `fast-check`, and `@types/node`. The last
   one is types-only, has no runtime footprint and cannot reach distributed code; without it the
   mutation instrument would either sit outside the typechecker or be written in plain JavaScript,
   and an unchecked `.ts` file would claim a guarantee the repository does not give it. Feature code
   still has zero runtime dependencies of any kind.
4. The root `package.json` carries `"private": true`, so nothing can be published by accident.
5. Working notes, planning documents and status reports do not belong in this repository. Only
   contracts, implementations, tests, and the evidence produced by running them.

## Permanent rules

These outlive the current stage and are not open to trade-off.

1. **No runtime indirection.** No dynamic resolution, no wrapper component, no network call at
   execution time. The only indirection is the user's import path, resolved at install time.
2. **No external npm dependency inside a feature.** A feature depends only on other registry
   features and on native language and runtime APIs. Wrapping an existing library is rejected on
   principle.
3. **No distribution from an external source.** Installations are served only from the registry's
   immutable snapshot, never from a third-party repository.
4. **Never update user code silently.** Notification, readable diff, explicit acceptance.
5. **Never hide a contract's tests.** Contracts are public in full; security by obscurity on them
   is forbidden. Auditability is the product.
6. **No breaking change to a published contract major.** A published version is frozen for life;
   an incompatible evolution creates `name@2` alongside `name@1`.
7. **Nothing trivial in the catalogue.** A contract exists only if it provides something the
   language does not give trivially — non-obvious behaviour, real edge cases, an algorithm, or the
   correction of a language trap.
8. **No validation bypass**, including for the founder's own submissions.

## Conventions

- English everywhere: code, identifiers, comments, tests, commit messages, documentation.
- Conventional commits, atomic. Never push and never create a remote.
- TypeScript `strict: true`.

## Verification discipline

This project sells verification. A decorative guard here is not a technical defect, it is a defect
of the thesis.

- A test that cannot fail is not a test. Before claiming a suite is green, break the implementation
  on its real failure condition and show the red output.
- A guard that is structurally incapable of failing must be recorded as inapplicable, with the
  reason — never written as a passing test that proves nothing.
- Every universal property carries a status — applicable or not applicable — together with its
  reason. One declared applicable must have been seen red on at least one plausible mutant.
- Distinguish what you **measured** (quote the command and its output) from what you **assume**.
  A coherent explanation is not a measurement.
- Report what you left out. Never narrow the scope silently.

## Asking questions

On a genuine ambiguity, blocker, or trade-off: stop and ask directly in the conversation, in prose.
Never use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Resolve trivia yourself.
