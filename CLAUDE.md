# Toopo

A registry of utility functions verified against public, executable contracts, distributed as
source code copied into the user's codebase.

A **contract** is the complete, executable behavioural specification of one function: identity,
TypeScript signature, property-based invariants, named and settled edge cases, and benchmark
profiles. The contract is owned by the registry; implementations compete underneath it and are
interchangeable.

The product of this project is the contract, not the utility code. **If the verification is
decorative, the project has no reason to exist.** That sentence is the acceptance criterion for
every change made here.

## Current stage

Five contracts are being written **by hand**, with no shared abstraction, so that the definitive
contract format emerges from repetition rather than being designed up front. The uncertainty of
this project lies in the contract format, not in the API or the CLI — which is why neither exists
yet.

- The five are written: `number/parse@1`, `date/add@1`, `array/group-by@1`, `string/levenshtein@1`,
  `string/slugify@1`. The third is a format prototype that will not be published, because ES2024
  shipped `Map.groupBy` and it answers what the contract specifies. The project specification records
  that refusal and the rule it establishes. The fourth is the first whose properties are strong by
  nature — the axioms of a metric — and its table is a third the size of the first's as a result. The
  fifth is the first with no oracle of any kind: measured over fifty-seven samples, the four most used
  slug libraries agree on seven, so nothing about its answers is true and every one of them has to be
  argued for.
- Project name: Toopo. CLI command `toopo`, lockfile `toopo.lock`.

## Error convention — settled, catalogue-wide

A fallible function returns `T | null` and publishes a diagnostic export **beside** it:
`describe<X>Failure(...)`, returning a reason literal owned by that contract, or `null`. No type is
shared between features — each contract declares its own literals.

Every contract that publishes a diagnostic carries a **coupling property**: a call fails exactly
when it has a description. Without it the two exports can drift, and an implementation that
optimises the answering path while leaving the diagnostic one alone will diverge on any input the
named cases do not cover.

Three forms were built and measured across both prototype contracts. The union
`{ ok, value } | { ok, reason }` ties this one on detection, so the error convention is not a
verification question. Read that tie at the strength it was actually measured: on `date/add@1` it is
a full-battery tie, every mutant under both lenses; on `number/parse@1` it rests on four mutants
under one lens. What decided it is that this form is **additive**: a contract can ship
`name@1` with no diagnostic and gain one later without breaking anyone, whereas putting the reason
in the return type freezes it into the major version on day one. Known costs are recorded in the
project specification, together with what would invalidate the decision.

Those measurements are replayable, at three annotated tags whose messages say what each one proves:
`evidence/error-convention-round-1` (two forms, six call sites), `evidence/error-convention-round-2`
(three forms on both contracts, and the batteries the detection tie comes from) and
`evidence/error-convention-round-3` (the callers that need the value and the reason at once). They
are tags rather than branches because the conclusion is on `main` and nobody should be reading three
dead working states — but a published sentence with no replayable measurement behind it is an
opinion, which is the one thing this repository sells against.

**The reason set of a contract is frozen with its major version.** Adding a literal, removing one,
or splitting one all break a caller that switches exhaustively — so the partition is chosen once,
deliberately, and a later change costs `name@2`. The additivity that decided this convention covers
gaining a diagnostic, not reshaping one.

## Case identifiers — settled, catalogue-wide

Every case of block 4.4 carries an `id`: a **name**, in kebab-case, unique within the contract and
**frozen with its major version**. Guards are titled by it and by nothing else.

A name, and not a rendering of the case's own data. `"1e400" -> overflow` restates the row it
addresses, so it can be wrong about it, and §4.4 makes every case one line of public documentation —
where false documentation is worse than none. The published line goes on being rendered from the
data; the identifier only addresses the case.

The measurement that forced it: the two fallible contracts titled their guards out of the very data a
specification battery injects into, so a mutant that changed an expectation reddened a guard under a
title the unmutated contract does not contain, and left the calibrated one silent — a hundred guards
of `number/parse@1` and eighty-six of `date/add@1` declared silent as an artefact of the apparatus.
`array/group-by@1` carried an explicit name and did not have the problem.

The reason that outlives the instrument is the registry's: an API response citing a case, a URL
anchor on a contract's page, a validation report naming the case a submission failed — each needs an
address, and an address that changes breaks links. Renaming one therefore costs `name@2`, exactly as
reshaping a reason set does.

## What a property settles — settled, catalogue-wide

A property that pins an exact answer on a generated family settles **exactly the decisions its
alphabet represents, and no others**. So for every decision a contract publishes about what its
answer should *be* — rather than about the shape of that answer — a reviewer can check that one of
two things is true: a representative of the decision is in the arbitrary, or a named case of block
4.4 settles it. The battery has to carry a mutant that says which, because the two look identical
from the outside.

Measured on `string/slugify@1`, whose battery reads the whole of block 4.4 blind on a second lens.
Twenty-one of its twenty-two behaviour defects still die on that column: shape properties turn out to
carry far more of the content than the table was written expecting. The twenty-second transliterates
Cyrillic, and it answers a well-formed, lower-case, idempotent slug that retains a subsequence — so
every property is satisfied, every benchmark profile keeps its class, and one guard in the whole
suite kills it: a named case. The control is a mutant folding the sharp s, the same kind of curation
decision from the same table the ecosystem writes, which dies on both columns — because the arbitrary
that draws well-formed slugs carries a sharp s and carries no Cyrillic.

What this forbids is the reading that a property is strong and a case is bookkeeping. A property is
as wide as its alphabet. Widening that alphabet is how a decision becomes property-checkable, and it
is a deliberate act with a cost — every symbol added is a decision the contract can no longer change
without the property going red, which is exactly what freezing means.

## Replaying a divergence — settled, catalogue-wide

A contract that answers differently from what the ecosystem or the language answers carries a guard
that **replays** the divergence on the rows where it happens, rather than asserting it in prose. The
guard names the exact set of cases that diverge, so a specification drifting back towards the common
answer takes the measurement refusing that answer with it, and the drift is red instead of silent.

Three contracts carry one, in three shapes: `array/group-by@1` in a file of its own against
`Object.groupBy`, `string/levenshtein@1` by recoding its table into UTF-16 code units,
`string/slugify@1` by narrowing its alphabet to ASCII. The shapes differ because what is being
diverged from differs; what is identical is that the divergence is measured on the contract's own
table rather than described.

`number/parse@1` and `date/add@1` both diverge — from `Number` and from every library's fractional
month — and neither carries such a guard. That is recorded here as a debt against this rule rather
than as an exception to it.

## Rules for this stage

1. Contracts and their reference implementations only. No backend, no API, no CLI, no website, no
   CI configuration, no publishing tooling. Those come after the five prototypes, deliberately.
2. **The no-abstraction suspension has ended**, having done its job: three contracts were written by
   hand with no shared code, and what they turned out to repeat *identically* now lives in
   `catalogue/`, under the freeze discipline stated at the top of that file. The bar for adding
   anything there is not "the contracts repeat it" but "the contracts repeat it identically, and
   what it says belongs to the registry rather than to any one feature". Resemblance is not
   duplication: three functions that answer the same question about different data stay apart.
3. Dev dependencies are limited to `typescript`, `vitest`, `fast-check`, and `@types/node`. The last
   one is types-only, has no runtime footprint and cannot reach distributed code; without it the
   mutation instrument would either sit outside the typechecker or be written in plain JavaScript,
   and an unchecked `.ts` file would claim a guarantee the repository does not give it. Feature code
   still has zero runtime dependencies of any kind.
4. The root `package.json` carries `"private": true`, so nothing can be published by accident.
5. Working notes, planning documents and status reports do not belong in this repository. Only
   contracts, implementations, tests, the evidence produced by running them, and the instrument that
   produces that evidence — including its own fixtures.
6. **Fixtures for the instrument live under `mutation/`, never under `contracts/`.** `contracts/` is
   the catalogue and nothing else. A fixture is a toy shaped like a contract so that the instrument
   can be mutation-tested in seconds rather than minutes; a meta-test nobody runs is a decorative
   guard, and the cost of running one is what decides whether it gets run. A fixture is deliberately
   minimal, is never a template for a real contract, and says so in its own header.

## Permanent rules

These outlive the current stage and are not open to trade-off.

1. **No runtime indirection.** No dynamic resolution, no wrapper component, no network call at
   execution time. The only indirection is the user's import path, resolved at install time.
2. **No external npm dependency inside a feature.** A feature depends only on other registry
   features and on native language and runtime APIs. Wrapping an existing library is rejected on
   principle.
3. **No distribution from an external source.** Installations are served only from the registry's
   immutable snapshot, never from a third-party repository.
4. **Never update user code silently.** Notification, readable diff, explicit acceptance.
5. **Never hide a contract's tests.** Contracts are public in full; security by obscurity on them
   is forbidden. Auditability is the product.
6. **No breaking change to a published contract major.** A published version is frozen for life;
   an incompatible evolution creates `name@2` alongside `name@1`.
7. **Nothing trivial in the catalogue.** A contract exists only if it provides something the
   language does not give trivially — non-obvious behaviour, real edge cases, an algorithm, or the
   correction of a language trap.
8. **No validation bypass**, including for the founder's own submissions.

## Conventions

- English everywhere: code, identifiers, comments, tests, commit messages, documentation.
- Conventional commits, atomic. Never push and never create a remote.
- TypeScript `strict: true`.

## Verification discipline

This project sells verification. A decorative guard here is not a technical defect, it is a defect
of the thesis.

- A test that cannot fail is not a test. Before claiming a suite is green, break the implementation
  on its real failure condition and show the red output.
- A guard that is structurally incapable of failing must be recorded as inapplicable, with the
  reason — never written as a passing test that proves nothing.
- Every universal property carries a status — applicable or not applicable — together with its
  reason. One declared applicable must have been seen red on at least one plausible mutant.
- Distinguish what you **measured** (quote the command and its output) from what you **assume**.
  A coherent explanation is not a measurement.
- Report what you left out. Never narrow the scope silently.

## Asking questions

On a genuine ambiguity, blocker, or trade-off: stop and ask directly in the conversation, in prose.
Never use the `AskUserQuestion` tool. Resolve trivia yourself.
