/**
 * Where a page lives, and the one rule that fixes it: **a page's address is the contract's address.**
 *
 * `registry/address.ts` was written on the promise that the site would make a case identifier a URL
 * anchor - it says so in its own first paragraph - and `renderCase` has sat there unread ever since,
 * rendering `number/parse@1#ordinary-integer`. That string is now literally the URL of a case, which
 * is what turns the freeze of those identifiers from a discipline into a payment.
 *
 * So a contract page is `/number/parse@1/`, a case is `#ordinary-integer` inside it, and neither can
 * move without the address moving. Nothing here invents a slug: a slug would be a second name for a
 * thing that already has one, and the first time the two disagreed a link would break in silence.
